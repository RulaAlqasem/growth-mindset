## 401 Reading Notes: Class 28

### Readings: Component Lifecycle / `useEffect()` Hook

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

  - React is a single-page application, with a single-page app this  prevent a page from refresshing every time a link is clicked. You can ue React Router to act like a  multi-page app.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and 
why?

  - Outside the `<BrowserRouter/>`
    - Anything outside of this component will render on every page

3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

  - Each router creates a history object that it uses to keep track of the current location and re-renders the application whenever this location changes. For this reason, the other React Router components rely on this history object being present; which is why they need to be rendered inside a router.

4. What does props.children contain?
  
  - The content passed to a component through props.children can include
undefined, null, a Boolean, a number, a string, a React element, or an array of any of these types recursively. It can also be a function returning one of these types. 

5. How do `useState()` and `this.setState()` differ?

  - `useState()` is use to set a hook for functional Componet and use `prods` to pass to child

  - `this.setState()` is use to set state for a Class component and use `this.prods` to pass to child

### Terms

- State Hook: are functions that let you hook into React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes.

- Mounting and Un-Mounting: A React component's lifecycle contains distinct phases for creation and deletion. In coding terms, these are called mounting and unmounting. You can also think of them as "setup" and "cleanup".
  - `componentWillMount` and `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods in the mounting phase
  - `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method in the unmounting phase [source](https://learn.co/lessons/react-component-mounting-and-unmounting)

  - you can use React hooks to do Mounting and Un-Mounting with `useEffect`


### Preparation Materials

 **Hooks**
A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. (Links to an external site.)
Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside a component, rather than just between the components


* What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.


* Why is useEffect called inside a component? Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.


* Does useEffect run after every render? Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.) Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.
