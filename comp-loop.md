## comparison operators:
|operator|name|PURPOSE
|---|---|---|
| == |  equal to | its compare two values to see if thye are the same  value|
|!= |not equal to | its compare two values to see if thye are not  the same value|
|=== |strict equal to  |its compare two values to see if thye are the same type and value|
|!== |strict equal not  to |its compare two values to see if thye are not  the same data and value|
|> |greater than| its checks if the number on the left greater than the number on the right |
|<| less than |its checks if the number on the left less than the number on the right| 
|>=| greater thane or equal to| its checks if the number on the left greater than  or equal to the number on the right |
|<= |less than or equal to| its checks if the number on the left less than or equal to  the number on the right |
|&& | and  | its give you true only if the two sides are true |
|   |or | its gives you false only if the two sides are false |
| ! | not | its gives you the opposit logic |

 

**for loop** :if you want to run the code repeatedly withe specifc number of time


**while loop**: if you want to run the code repeatedly withe  more than one time and you dont know how many time .


**do while loop**: its always run the statment onece even if the condition is false 

### the counter :
* initialization:create a variable and set it to a number
* condition :the number of time that the program repeate
* update : adds or subtract  the counter
