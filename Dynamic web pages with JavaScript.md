|Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content| Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself|The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.|

## CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT 
* Create a folder withe js extention .
* put your code on it 
* creat HTML folder withe script tags and put the js code on it 

**The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created.**

**The source of the web page does not actually show the new element that has been added into the page; it just shows the link to the JavaScript file.**
