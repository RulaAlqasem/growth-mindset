# array

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
CREATING AN ARRAY :

* array literal  :
  colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];

* array constructor.
 colors= ['white',
'black',
'custom'];

**VALU ES IN ARRAYS**:
the array convweart the data to a number in the memory of it
any number  in array calld an index
II Create the array

var colors = ['white',
'black' ,
'custom'];
**Update the third item in the array**
colors[2] = 'beige ' ;
**Get the element with an id of col ors**
var el = document .getElementByid(' colors') ;
**Replace with third item from the array**
el .textContent = colors[2];

# switch statment:

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

• You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
• If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running

type coercion: JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation

avaScript is said to use weak typing because the data type for a value can change.
Falsy values are treated as if they are fa1se.: 0 , fals , 10/'score' ,NAN

Truthy values: are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true.
