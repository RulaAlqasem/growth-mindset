**How computer work ?**
**How information is represented?**
**How the computer use circuit ?**
* Any computer in the world take the input storage  information (data) processing it then give output .
1. Input: telling the computer what to do
2. Process: the computer analyses an decided what to do with input 
3. Output: what you see on screen 

* Binary :its any system with two option  
  * Example :yes no ,0 1 ,true false, on off .
The computer use 0 1 binary and the value of number depend on the 0 1 position 
**1 wire is 2 pit**  
*Text and voice and color can represent with binary*
###Logic itâ€™s a circuit its what process information that represent in 0 1 
Ex :
* Not circuit : input 1 will return 0 output 
* And circuit :tow input give you one output  ,all input will return 0 except the input 1 1 will return 1.
**Every operation in computer is a lot of circuit an logic circuit .**
