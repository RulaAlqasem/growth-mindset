### Reading: Redux - Combined Reducers

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
  - Context API prompts a re-render on each update of the state and re-renders all components regardless. Redux however, only re-renders the updated components. Redux is use for larger applications where there are high-frequency state updates.

2. What is the purpose of a reducer?
  - Reducers are responsible for how the application changes in response to an action made by an end-user.

3. What does an action contain?
  - Actions are the only source of information for the Store. Actions carry the information that sends data from the application to the Store.

4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
  - If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.

### Terms

- immutable state: ultimately makes data handling safer. Time-travel debugging requires that reducers be pure functions with no side effects, so that you can correctly jump between different states.

- time travel in redux: the ability step forward and backward through the state of you application, empowering the developer understand exactly what is happening at any point in the app's lifecycle. Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time

- action creator: a function that returns an action object. Redux includes a utility function called bindActionCreators for binding one or more action creators to the store's dispatch() function.

- reducer: a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state

- dispatch: a function of the Redux store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.


### Preparation Materials
   
Reducers are a great concept in Redux, because they allow your react application to have specific pieces of data that all update synchronously.  All reducers run against your Redux store, and then the store triggers a change event and your entire React.js application re-renders.

The biggest thing to keep in mind with Redux reducers is you don't want to mutate your state.  ALWAYS return a new state rather than mutating the old state values.

#### Using combineReducers

There are several important ideas to be aware of when using combineReducers:

* First and foremost, combineReducers is simply a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers. 

* While Redux itself is not opinionated about how your state is organized, combineReducers enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors.

* One frequently asked question is whether Redux "calls all reducers" when dispatching an action. Since there really is only one root reducer function, the default answer is "no, it does not". However, combineReducers has specific behavior that does work that way. 

* you can use it at all levels of your reducer structure, not just to create the root reducer. It's very common to have multiple combined reducers in various places
