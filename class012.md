# EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS

Charts:displaying data visually and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.

uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

## Setting up:
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js.

## Drawing a line chart
* create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. 
* write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas.

Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart.


The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. Plus, once you’ve mastered the basics here, you’ll discover that there are tons of options listed in the documentation.
