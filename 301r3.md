"Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity"

#  spread operator
What is the spread operator? syntax used to add elements to arrays, merge arrays or objects, and propagate an array into function argument suses of an ellipsis of three dots
List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
* The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments
* copy an array or combine arrays
* Using an array as arguments
* Adding to state in React

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

```

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```
