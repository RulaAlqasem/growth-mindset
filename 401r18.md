### 1) What are serverless functions?

A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

### 2) If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

* Open the Functions page on the Lambda console.

* Choose Create function.

* Under Basic information, do the following:

     a) For Function name, enter my-function.

    b) For Runtime, confirm that Node.js 14.x is selected. Note that Lambda provides runtimes for .NET (PowerShell,C#) Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

* Choose Create function.

Lambda creates a Node.js function and an execution role that grants the function permission to upload logs. The Lambda function assumes the execution role when you invoke your function, and uses the execution role to create credentials for the AWS SDK and to read data from event sources.

### 3) Describe how a CDN works?

To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website's server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations.In essence, CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users.



## Preparation Materials

## Amazon API Gateway
 is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services.
* Many AWS services support integration with Amazon API Gateway, including:
    * **AWS Lambda:** run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
    * **AWS SNS:** publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
    *  **Amazon Cognito:** provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

### Benefits
* Efficient API development
* Performance at any scale
* Cost savings at scale
* Easy monitoring
* Flexible security controls
* RESTful API options

## DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

* reliable performance even as it scales;
* a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
* a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
### Benefits:
- Performance at scale
- No servers to manage
- Enterprise ready








### Term

- Serverless Functions

    - A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS.

- Cloud Storage
   - Cloud storage allows you to save data and files in an off-site location that you access either through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection. Data that you transfer off-site for storage becomes the responsibility of a third-party cloud provider.

- CDN

    - A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. ... Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request
