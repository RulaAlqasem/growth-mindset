### Reading: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How granular should your reducers be?
  - The more UI components subscribed to the Redux store and reading data at a more granular level, leads to better UI performance, as fewer components will need to render when a given piece of state changes.

2. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can "fire" when a commonly named action is dispatched
  - Pro: Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object. Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior.

3. Name a strategy for preventing the above
  - Redux provides the `combineReducers` utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.

### Terms

- store: holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

- combined reducers: helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.

#### Redux Middleware and Side Effects
A “side effect” is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:
- Logging a value to the console
- Saving a file
- Setting an async timer
- Making an AJAX HTTP request
- Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
- Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())
#### Redux Thunk
is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed
