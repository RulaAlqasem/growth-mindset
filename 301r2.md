## how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.
```
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```


You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

* Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
* Add a single empty method to it called render().
* Move the body of the function into the render() method.
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
* Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```


## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example, the HTML:
```
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```
is slightly different in React:
``` 
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>

```

Conditional Rendering
In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

Consider these two components:

```
function UserGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
}

function GuestGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
}

```
We’ll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:

```
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }
  return <GuestGreeting />;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true}:
  <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

## Element Variables
You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.


## Inline If with Logical && Operator
You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator.

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers
Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler.
