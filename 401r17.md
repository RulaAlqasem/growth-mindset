* Describe “The Cloud”
    
    - its a servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
    -  standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

* What is auto-scaling?
   - its  monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

* What is bandwidth?
   - its describes the maximum data transfer rate of a network or Internet connection.

* How do cloud providers compute service costs?
   - its a calculated based on the resources the company or individual may use in the VM in order to run their apps/services smoothly. These recourses may be storage, processor, bandwidth and RAM.


### Term
- Server Instances
    -  server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
- Containers
     - A container is any receptacle or enclosure for holding a product used in storage, packaging, and transportation, including shipping.
- Cloud Services
     - Cloud services are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.
- Cloud Architecture
     - Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them. ... Cloud resources.
- AWS
     - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud computing platform in the world and one of the pioneers of on-demand computing. AWS launched in 2006 with a simple queuing service for application developers and soon expanded to offer elastic compute, and simple storage services.
     
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS), while Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product.

## Preparation Materials


### AWS S3

- Cloud object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security and performance
- Capability to scale your storage resources up and down to meet fluctuating demands
- Stores data across the S3 storage classes which support different data access levels at corresponding rates
- Store your data in Amazon S3 and secure it from unauthorized access with encryption features and access management tools
- S3 is the only object storage service that allows you to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket or the account level
- S3 Access Points make it easy to manage data access with specific permissions for your applications using a shared data set
- Use cases: backup and restore, disaster recovery, archive, data lakes and big data analytics, hybrid cloud storage, cloud-native applications


### AWS Lambda

- AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services
- Each Lambda function runs in its own container
- When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS
- Before the functions start running, each function’s container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity
- Once the functions finish running, the RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running
- The customers then get charged based on the allocated memory and the amount of run time the function took to complete
- One of the distinctive architectural properties of AWS Lambda is that many instances of the same function, or of different functions from the same AWS account, can be executed concurrently
- Common use cases for Lambda: scalable APIs, data processing, task automation


### CDN

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

- A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request.

- The content delivery network copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are spread out at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page
- When a user requests a webpage that is part of a content delivery network, the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site’s server to a server in the CDN that is closest to the user and deliver the cached content
- CDNs will also communicate with the originating server to deliver any content that has not been previously cached
- Speed is improved by distributing content closer to the website visitors by using a nearby CDN server, causing visitors to experience faster page loading times
