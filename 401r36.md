### Reading: Application State with Redux

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in "Cookies" vs "Local Storage"
  - Cookies cannot be accessed using JavaScript. If an attacker can run JS on your site, they can't read your access token from the cookie. It's automatically sent in every HTTP request to your server.

2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
  -  cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on.

3. How do pixel tags work?
  - By adding a tracking pixel using a code in your site's HTML code or email, which contains an external link to the pixel server. When someone visits your website, the HTML code is processed by their browser, which follows the link and opens the hidden graphic.

### Terms

- cookies: are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user’s web browser.

- authorization: the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.

- access control:  that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment

- conditional rendering: describe the ability to render different user interface markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition.

### Preparation Materials
   - Redux
     Redux is an open source JavaScript library for managing application state ,It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to  Facebook’s Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.
     
     it provides a solution by ensuring that: Your state is wrapped in a store which handles all updates and notifies all code that subscribes to the store of updates to the state
     
     The principles of it aren’t new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs
