## The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
 block level elements: h1-h6 ,p tag
 inline elements : b tag  ,i tag  ,img tag ,em tag ,span tag 
css rule had a two part :
selectors:indicat wiche ilement the rule applies to
declaration:indicate how the element refarred to in the selector should be styled.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two  parts:
Properties: indicate the aspects  of the element you want to  change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
Values :specify the settings  you want to use for the chosen  properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property  then the value is the color you  want the text in these elements to be.
The link tag: element can be used in an HTML document to tell the  browser where to find the CSS  file used to style the page.
href :This specifies the path to the CSS file
type :This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The  value should be text/css.
rel This specifies the relationship  between the HTML page and  the file it is linked to. 
function :its alike a file that you can save comand in it to be faster and to not repeat the comand mor than one 
you have to call it after you write it .

## we can represint the color wit more than one way :
name: blu,red,green...
hexadecimal number: #00 00 ff "blue",#00 ff 00 "green...
rgba:"red green blue " :from 0-255  ex: 000 000 255 "blue"
hsl: hue saturation light , 
hu :colore dgree on the colores weel 
saturation :ammaunt of the gray 
light :ammount of the white .
 we can use rgba or hsla and this is for opacity .
