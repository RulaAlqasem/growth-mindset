What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
is one that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks 
Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?
yes
Why?
"because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. ."
How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
`event.preventDefault();`
` event.target.value`

Why would we use a ternary operator?
if we want to check condetion true or false tin give value ,its like uysing if statement but its shorter 
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
  ```
  
  ```
( x===y)?  console.log(true) :console.log(false);
  ```
