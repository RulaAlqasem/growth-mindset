# Context API

Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()

`useReducer()` is preferred over `useState()` when we have complex state logic or instances when state changes are progressive. It works well with the following examnple situations:
- JavaScript objects or arrays as state
- complex state transitions
- differing but intertwining properties that should be managed in one state object



## Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

The name of any custom hook should begin with `use`. This convention indicates to developers that hooks are used within the file/custom hook.

## What do custom hooks usually do?

They allow the creation of modular functionality, usable across multiple components, with the advantage of being able to 'hook' into the React API for things like state and component lifecycle.

## Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

This is a toss-up for me between `useFormState` and `constate`. I really like the simplicity of useFormState, and I am sure I will use it at some point, but being able to use constate to share state across components definitely sounds good to me.

## Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

The hook might take in a url, a method, and a body. Using axios or something similar, useState and possibly useEffect, an API call can be made based on and using the parameters passed in and then an objects state could be 'set' based on the results of the API call.

| **reducer** | *manages state in an application. A reducer is a function which takes two arguments -- the current state and an action -- and returns based on both arguments a new state.* [*"What is a Reducer in JavaScript/React/Redux?"*](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-reducer) |


#  Preparation Materials

### context api
 Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree;
and its designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

### React.createContext:
Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.

### Caveats:
Because context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders. For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value
