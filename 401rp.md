# How to Solve Programming Problems?

1. Read the problem completely twice
 You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
You want to make sure you completely understand the problem. A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

2. Solve the problem manually

when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.

3. Optimize the manual solution

People often don’t realize how valuable this step is. It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

4. Write pseudocode or comments

Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. In other words, your pseudocode is your step-by-step plan for how to solve the problem.

5. Carry out the plan (Solve the problem!)

This step should be extremely easy at this point. If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.


# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour .
many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission. The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth. They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take. They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.

Successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction, They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

# How to think like a programmer .
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding) :

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

# How to Use the 5 Whys
when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking “Why?” five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

1. Assemble a Team
contact with people have the same problem.

2. Define the Problem

observe the problem in action, and Discuss it.

3. Ask the First “Why?”

don’t guess why that happens, search about it.

4. Ask “Why?” Four More Times

For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further “whys” in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you’ve just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop
when the root cause of the problem when asking “why” produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.

6. Address the Root Cause
7. Monitor Your Measures
