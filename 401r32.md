## Context API - Behaviors

### When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

The difference is pretty obvious. Class components are ES6 classes and Functional Components are functions. The only constraint for a functional component is to accept props as an argument and return valid JSX.

### What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?
- Twilio : Twilio really defines what it means to be API-driven.
- Stripe : Stripe is one of the most successful and best known API-driven businesses.
- Ebay : Unlike the previous companies, eBay didn’t start out with the intent of being API-driven.
- Salesforce : XML APIs have been a part of Salesforce since day one, back in 2000 when it launched.
- Rovi :Rovi is definitely the oldest company on the list, founded as Macrovision in 1983.


### How can you best test context?
The best way to test Context is to make our tests unaware of its existence and avoiding mocks. We want to test our components in the same way that developers would use them (behavioral testing) and mimic the way they would run in our applications (integration testing).

# Terms
- context : ontext is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs. When you use the JavaScript “this” keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs.

- useContext() : “useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level.

- static context : Static context defines items that are needed to prepare executables, items such as the names and types of external variables and functions that will be available at run time as well as compilation modes like backwards compatibility, math mode, and so on. These items do


# Preparation Materials
- Context : 

  **When to Use Context** : 
  
    “Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language”.

**Before You Use Context** :

   “Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult”.

   “If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context”.

- React.createContext : 

   - “Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree”.


Context.Provider: 
   - “Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes”.
   
   - “The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree”.


**Class.contextType :** 
   - “The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext()”.


**Context.Consumer :** 
  - “A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component”.
