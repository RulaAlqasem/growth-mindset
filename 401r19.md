# Reading 19 : AWS: Events


### 1) Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

Express is commonly used for both web applications as well as REST APIs. While the primary API Gateway function is to deliver APIs, it can certainly be used for delivering web apps/sites (HTML) as well.

### 2) List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

* reliable performance even as it scales;
* a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
* a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.



### 3) What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.


### 4) How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a tag attached to a message to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the message. It is derived by applying a MAC algorithm to a message in combination with a secret key.


### Term
- Serverless API
    - Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.

- Triggers
    - A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs

- Dynamo vs Mongo
    - DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions
      
- Dynamoose vs Mongoose
    - Dynamoose is a DynamoDB API structured like Mongoose, lets us provide a schema and perform CRUD operations against a DynamoDB table, installed via node and configured based on role.


### Preparation Materials


SQS and SNS are important components for scalable, large scale, distributed, cloud-based applications:
SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service.
SQS is distributed queuing service.

**Amazon SNS** is a fast, flexible, fully managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages or to bulk messages to large numbers of recipients. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost effective to send push notifications to mobile device users, email recipients or even send messages to other distributed services.

**SQS** is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll SQS to receive messages. Messages can’t be received by multiple receivers at the same time. Any one receiver can receive a message, process and delete it. Other receivers do not receive the same message later.
Polling inherently introduces some latency in message delivery in SQS unlike SNS where messages are immediately pushed to subscribers.
