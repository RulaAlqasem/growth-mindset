# Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

## 401 Reading Notes: Class 34

### Reading: `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is the Context API useful?
  - enable components to share some data without explicitly passing via each component manually. Context is like a global object to the React component sub-tree.

2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
  - no, it will throw an error

3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
  - 1. Themes: The ability to set the theme that provides dark mode and light mode which makes it easy to read in the low light situation.

  - 2. Multilingual application: To implement multiple languages in app we have to change the text in every component and replace with the translated text. 
  
  - 3. Authorization: setting the user role and info

4. Describe "Context Hell"
  - multiple Context Provider nested or wrap around each other
  ```javascript
  <AppContextProvider>
  <AnotherProvider>
    <AgainAnotherProvider configProp={false}>
      <TestProvider>
        <FooProvider>
          <BarProvider configHereAlso={someEnvronmentVar}>
            <BazProvider>
              <BatProvider>
                <App />
              </BatProvider>
            </BazProvider>
          </BarProvider>
        </FooProvider>
      </TestProvider>
    </AgainAnotherProvider>
  </AnotherProvider>
</AppContextProvider>;
```

### Terms

- global state: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, managing state in multiple components that are not directly connected.

- global context: is designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 

- provider: component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

- consumer: component that subscribes to context changes

### Preparation Materials

  #### role based access control

  - **what is role based access control?**
       
       - RBAC restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

  - **EXAMPLES OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL**

       - Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
       - Management role group – you can add and remove members.
       - Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
       - Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.


  - **BENEFITS OF RBAC**
     - Reducing administrative work and IT support
     - Maximizing operational efficiency
     - Improving compliance


#### react-cookies component

 - Install
     `` $ npm install react-cookies --save ``
 - usage
      `` import cookie from 'react-cookies' ``
      
 -  Example

```
        import cookie from 'react-cookies'

        componentWillMount() {
          this.state =  { token: cookie.load('token') }
          // => 123456789
        }
```


#### react-cookie library

   - useCookies([dependencies])
        - Access and modify cookies using React hooks.

          ``const [cookies, setCookie, removeCookie] = useCookies(['cookie-name']);``
   - withCookies(Component)

      - Give access to your cookies anywhere. Add the following props to your component:

           1- cookies: Cookies instance allowing you to get, set and remove cookies.
           
           2- allCookies: All your current cookies in an object.

   - get(name, [options])
   
      - Get a cookie value
      
  - getAll([options])
  
     - Get all cookies
    
  - set(name, value, [options])
      
      - Set a cookie value
  
  - remove(name, [options])
       
       - Remove a cookie
