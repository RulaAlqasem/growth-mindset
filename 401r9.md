### **What is SQL?**
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
* you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted



_**Example**_  :
```
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;
```
``` 
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;

```
