## HTML & CSS & JavaScript 


*HTML* provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like *CSS* and *JavaScript*. **CSS** is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.


## JavaScript 
is a programming language we use it inside our website with HTML and CSS to add interactive and dynamic in our websites.


## Data types for JavaScript:
 
- Numbers (1 , -1 , 1.5 ..)
+ Strings (any text goes between single quote or qoutation mark
* Boolean (true , false )


## Operators :
  
  * Assignment operators (=)
  * Comparison operators (== , != , === , !== , ...)
  * Arithmatic operators ( + , - , * , /)
  * Logical operators (&& ,  )
  
  
 **Variables**  is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
  
  *There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable:*
  
  1-Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
  
  2-After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
 
 3-JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
