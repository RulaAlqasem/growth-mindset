# to learn java scripts you have to learn html and css first 
**a script** : is a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand
you cane compare the  scripts with 
* RECIPES: the scripts are instructions  the computer can follw step by step .
* HANDBOOKS: a browser may use different parts of script depinding on haw the user interact with the web page .
* MANUALS: scripts can open differentg type of the cod depinding on the situation around them .

## WRITING A SCRIPT:
1. DEFINE THE GOAL :the task you want to achieve. 
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT : split the goal out into a series of tasks that contain the order you want to use .
3. CODE EACH STEP: writ Each one  of the steps withe  JavaScript language FROM STEPS TO CODE:

1. you need to get to grips with the:
* Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
* Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow
2.  also need to learn how a computer achieves different types of goals using a programmatic approach to problem-solving.  You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them. 

## DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT

* EXPRESSIONS:
  * two types of expressions. 
    1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE :In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value                                                   example :var color = 'beige';  The value of co 1 or is now beige.
    1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE : You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. 
    example: var area = 3 * 2;  The value of area is now 6.  


## arithmetic operators :
name|OPERATOR| PURPOSE 
|---|---|---|
|ADDITION|  +|  Adds one value to another|
|SUBTRACTION| -|  Subtracts one value from another|
| DIVISION | / | Divides two values|
| MULTIPLICATION | *  | Multiplies two values using an asterisk|
|INCREMENT|  + + | Adds one to the current number |
|DECREMENT | -- | Subtracts one from the current number |
|MODULUS| % | Divides two values and returns the remainder|

## STRING OPERATOR  
* var name  = 'name of file'
* var number = 12
**you can use +  to  mix strings and numbers
If you try to use any of the other arithmetic operators on a string, then the value that results is usually a value called NaN. This means "not a number."**
