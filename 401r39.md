### Reading: Redux - Redux - Additional Topics

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What’s the best practice for "pre-loading" data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
  - The way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method it needs to be handled with a reducer that puts it into your app store. This will require you to use some sort of a thunk middleware to handle the asynchronous action. Then you will use `mapStateToProps` to simply pass it down to the component that renders the data.

2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
  - if this is a function, don't pass it to the reducer, wait for the function to finish first

### Terms

- middleware: is a function returning a function, which takes next as a parameter. Then the inner function returns another function which takes action as a parameter and finally returns next(action)

- thunk: A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. Allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

### Preparation Materials

- Redux Toolkit

set of tools that handle the most common use cases and reduce the need to make extra decisions. that makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

Redux Toolkit was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

“Configuring a Redux store is too complicated” “I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful” “Redux requires too much boilerplate code”

- MobX

MobX is unopinionated and allows you to manage your application state outside of any UI framework. This makes your code decoupled, portable, and above all, easily testable.

a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution. This tutorial will teach you all the important concepts of MobX in ten minutes. MobX is a standalone library, but most people are using it with React and this tutorial focuses on that combination.

MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.
