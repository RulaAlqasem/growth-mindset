# Reading note 16 

## Review, Research, and Discussion


1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

 The user opens the browser, and search for URL Then the  browser makes a request for that URL.
 The request hits the Rails router and The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request Then action receives the request and pass it on to the view. and The view renders the page as HTML after that The controller sends the HTML back to the browser and The page loads and the user sees it.
    
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC ? It is the operator of the requests.


3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?  Publish the webapp online and move it from local host to cloud.


## Vocabulary Terms

* Server
SERVER is simply a computer that runs all the time and deal with requests (HTTP) and responses form clients or other servers, also sending requests to the database and back to the clients with responses.

* Pub/Sub

# Preparation Material

## Virtual Machine 
type of software that will allow us to run more than one OS (operating System, is a software that allow us to control the Hardware) on the same computer! 

A virtual machine is a process of having more than one operating system and making them working inside each other as if each was an individual machine on its own.



## Virtualization

is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation. You can't have cloud computing without virtualization.

## AWS

Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

 ## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed
